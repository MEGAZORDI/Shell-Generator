This is version 1.0 of my first pentest tool. 

A shell is a program that receives, interprets and executes user commands, appearing on the screen as a command line, represented by a command interpreter, which waits for the user's commands on the screen.

With this in mind, we pentesters deal with shells all the time and to automate and facilitate our operation, I developed this program.

I still have a lot to work on this project and I leave here some of my ideas not in order. To do:

1 - Add listener when shell is generated
2 - Animation on points
3 - Add more payloads, Windows is a priority 
4 - Powershell base64 is a priority
